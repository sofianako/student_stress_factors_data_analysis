This is a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics course written in a jupyter notebook. \
It is also published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sofianako/student-stress-factors-capstone-project-in-r).

It focuses on a **comprehensive analysis of student stress factors**. \
The used dataset is public on Kaggle made by [Chhabi Acharya](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rxnach/student-stress-factors-a-comprehensive-analysis).
